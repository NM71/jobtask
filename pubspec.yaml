  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/services_images/
    - assets/images/carousel_images/
    - assets/fonts/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/images/categories/
    - assets/lottie/
    - .env


  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: OC-Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/-OCPajaro-Regular.ttf

    - family: Outfit-Bold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Outfit-Bold.ttf
    
    - family: Outfit-SemiBold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Outfit-SemiBold.ttf

    - family: Outfit-ExtraBold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Outfit-ExtraBold.ttf

    - family: Outfit-ExtraLight
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Outfit-ExtraLight.ttf

    - family: Sofia-Pro
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Sofia Pro Regular.ttf

    - family: Outfit
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Outfit-Regular.ttf

    - family: Halvetica
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/HelveticaNowText-Regular.ttf
